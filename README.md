Codec Technologies - Cloud Computing Internship


**Overview**

This repository contains documentation and screenshots of three progressive cloud computing projects completed during my internship at Codec Technologies. Each project demonstrates different aspects of cloud infrastructure, security, and deployment strategies.

Skills Demonstrated Across All Projects

Through these three projects I have demonstrated proficiency in several interconnected areas of cloud computing.

AWS Cloud Services: I gained hands-on experience with core AWS services including S3 for storage and hosting, VPC for network design, EC2 for compute resources, load balancing for traffic distribution, and IAM for security and permissions management.

Network Security: I implemented proper network segmentation creating DMZ and private zones, configured multiple firewall layers using both Security Groups and NACLs, designed secure access patterns with bastion hosts, and applied the principle of least privilege throughout the architecture.

Cloud Architecture: I designed for high availability using multiple availability zones, implemented defense-in-depth security strategies, created scalable architectures using load balancers, and properly documented all architectural decisions and implementations.

DevOps and Deployment: I worked with infrastructure as code concepts through AWS console, deployed applications to cloud platforms like Netlify, integrated external APIs into web applications, and understood continuous deployment workflows.

Cybersecurity Relevance: These projects directly relate to cloud security analyst roles, security operations center positions, and cloud architecture security reviews. The skills demonstrated include threat modeling through proper network design, implementing security controls at multiple layers, understanding attack surfaces and how to minimize them, and documenting security architectures for compliance and auditing.

Future Learning Goals
This internship has prepared me for several next steps in my cloud and cybersecurity career. I plan to pursue AWS Security Specialty certification to deepen my security knowledge, learn Infrastructure as Code using Terraform or CloudFormation to automate deployments, explore container security with Docker and Kubernetes, and study advanced topics like WAF implementation, DDoS protection, and security monitoring with CloudWatch and GuardDuty.
